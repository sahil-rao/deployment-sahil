For the addredisslave.yml script to work, tag_Name_RedisSlaves must be defined in 
/etc/ansible/hosts. But the tag_Name_RedisSlaves should/may include machines also in tag_Name_Redis

example:

[tag_Name_Redis]
ip0 #this is the master
ip1
ip2

[tag_Name_RedisSlaves]
ip1
ip2

----

Notice that ip0 is not in RedisSlaves, as we have defined it as the master.
By convention, the first ip listed in tag_Name_Redis will default to the 'actual' master.
The rest of the ips will also be masters before addredisslave.yml is run, but 
Sentinel will just never discover them and so neither will the rest of the backoffice services.
The script addredisslave.yml will change them into slaves of the first ip in tag_Name_Redis. 
At this point Sentinel will discover them and the machines will become useful as slaves.
