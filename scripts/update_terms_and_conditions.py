The Receiving Party will, during the term of this Agreement and for three years thereafter, use the same degree of care to maintain the confidence of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that it uses to maintain the confidence of its own Confidential Information, but in no event less than reasonable care. Any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party will be used by the Receiving Party solely for the purpose of carrying out the Receiving Party&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement. In addition, the Receiving Party will not reproduce Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party, in any form, except as required to accomplish the Receiving Party&rsquo;s obligations under this Agreement. &nbsp;Confidential Information will not include information that: (a) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this Agreement and through no fault of the Receiving Party; (b) the Receiving Party can reasonably demonstrate was in its possession prior to first receiving it from the Disclosing Party; (c) the Receiving Party can demonstrate was developed by the Receiving Party independently and without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party&rsquo;s Confidential Information; or (d) the Receiving Party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure and without breach of a nondisclosure obligation. &nbsp;The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent compelled to do so pursuant to a judicial or legislative order or proceeding; provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Receiving Party provides to the Disclosing Party prior notice of the intended disclosure and an opportunity to respond or object to the disclosure or if prior notice is not permitted by applicable law, prompt notice of such disclosure; and provided further that the Receiving Party must limit the scope of Confidential Information that is disclosed to only that which is required to be disclosed by the applicable order or proceeding. The parties agree that damages would be an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach of this Section 5.1. Therefore, the parties agree that a party is entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies otherwise available, to seek injunctive and other equitable relief in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the other party of this Section 5.1.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Personally Identifiable Information</span><span class="c6">. &nbsp;Subject to applicable law, in connection with the performance of this Agreement and Customer&rsquo;s use of the Cloudera Products, (i) Cloudera agrees that it will not require Customer to deliver to Cloudera any personally identifiable information (as defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology) (&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">PII</span><span class="c6">&rdquo;) and (ii) Customer agrees not to deliver any PII to Cloudera.</span></p><ol class="c10 lst-kix_list_5-0" start="5"><li class="c0 c4"><span class="c3">Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer</span><span class="c6">.</span></li></ol><p class="c0"><span class="c3">General Representations and Warranties</span><span class="c6">.

Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other rights or remedies provided hereunder or by law. The waiver of one breach or default or any delay in exercising any rights will not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Notices</span><span class="c6">.
